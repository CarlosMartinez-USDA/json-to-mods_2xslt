For certain tests, this manifests itself as a test difference upon 180Â° in-plane rotation of the sheet. Seven of eight different paper grades ranging in grammage from 73 to 268 g\/m2 were found to show this difference for Scott internal bond tests, directional brightness tests, or both. Directional effects were compared using an extensional and a shear metric. One-third of comparisons showed significant directional effects at the 75-100% confidence level, including roughly equal numbers of Scott bond and brightness comparisons. However, the two tests did not reinforce each other strongly; agreement regarding directional effects occurred in only 60% of comparisons. The number of significant effects in the cross-machine direction matched those in the machine direction (MD), suggesting a more complex model may he needed. The best support for the fiber-tilt model was in the case of MD Scott-internal-bondtesting.\",\n    \"citation\": \"Vahey, David W.; Considine, John M. 2007.
