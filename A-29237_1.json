The influence of clay on crystallization behavior, mechanical properties, water absorption, and thermal stability of HDPE\/pine composites was investigated. The HDPE\/pine composites containing exfoliated clay were made by a two-step melt compounding procedure with the aid of a maleated polyethylene (MAPE). The use of 2% clay decreased the crystallization temperature (Tc), crystallization rate, and the crystallinity level of the HDPE\/pine composites, but did not change the crystalline thickness. When 2% MAPE was added, the crystallization rate increased, but the crystallinity level was further lowered. The flexural and tensile strength of HDPE\/ pine composites increased about 20 and 24%, respectively, with addition of 1% clay, but then decreased slightly as the clay content increased to 3%. The tensile modulus and tensile elongation were also increased with the addition of 1% clay. The impact strength was lowered about 7% by 1% clay, but did not decrease further as more clay was added. The MAPE improved the state of dispersion in the composites. Moisture content and thickness swelling of the HDPE\/pine composites was reduced by the clay, but the clay did not improve the composite thermal stability.\",\n    \"citation\": \"Lei, Yong; Wu, Qinglin; Clemons, Craig M.; Yao, Fei; Xu, Yanjun. 2007.
