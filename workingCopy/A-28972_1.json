The data present current and historical information on the production, trade, consumption, and prices of timber products in the United States. The report focuses on national statistics, but includes some data for individual States and regions and for Canada. The data were collected from industry trade associations and government agencies. They are intended for use by forest land managers, forest industries, trade associations, forestry schools, renewable resource organizations, individuals in the major timber producing and consuming countries of the world, and the general public. A major use of the data is tracking industry production and consumption trends over time. One of the major shifts occurring in the wood using industry over the last 2 years is that both production and consumption of roundwood per capita have been increasing. The consumption of products per capita also increased over the last 2 years. Because of increased paper recycling and increased processing efficiency, the consumption per capita in roundwood equivalent has decreased since about 1987 from 83 ft3 to 72 ft3 per capita. In the 1960s and 1970s, consumption averaged 65 ft3 per capita. Per capita consumption in 2004 increased to 71 ft3 per capita before increasing further in 2005 to 72 ft3 per capita. Another shift occurring during 2005 is increased emphasis on wood energy use, which has shown wide fluctuations over the last decade into 2005.\",\n    \"citation\": \"Howard, James L. 2007.
