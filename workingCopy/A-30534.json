    "abstract": "The quinone methide from guaiacylglycol-ß-guaiacyl ether underwent nucleophilic addition to the a-carbon with primary and secondary amines at 40°C. At pulping temperature, 170°C, only the primary amine adduct was detected. The quinone methide from guaiacylglycerol-ß-guaiacyl ether gave analogous adducts at 40°C, but no quinone methide-amine adducts were detected at 170°C. Instead, the major products were the vinyl ether and a substituted vinyl ether which resulted from a Mannich reaction of the vinylether, amine, and liberated formaldehyde.",
