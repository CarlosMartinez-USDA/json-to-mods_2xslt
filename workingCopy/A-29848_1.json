About 6,000 board feet of lumber, ranging in size from 3 in. by 8 in. to 3 in. by 12 in., was remilled into four products including log cabin siding, V-groove paneling, beadboard (wainscoting), and tongue and groove flooring. The general quality of the products produced was high and little loss was found after processing, although checks, ringshake, and face-nail holes were found in some pieces. The yield of value-added products was rather low (about 33%) and was constant over lumber size and product type. The authors believe yield could be increased with better on-site trimming.\",\n    \"citation\": \"Janowiak, John J.; Falk, Robert H.; Kimmel, Jeffery D. 2007.
