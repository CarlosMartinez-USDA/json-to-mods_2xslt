    "abstract": "To be a successful marina owner and operator, it’s important to understand all the facets of one’s facility, including the intricacies of one part of the marina that most boaters take for granted: the docks.  When it comes to dock construction, marinas have a wide-range of materials to choose from, with one of the most commonly used materials being preservative-treated wood.  This article examines the role the government plays and the role marinas and contractors can play when using wood for construction purposes.",
