    "title": "Determining moisture gradient profile using X-Ray technique",
    "product_year": " 2007",
    "abstract": "Moisture gradients in wood are known to affect the internal stresses that could cause dimensional changes and defects. Severe deformation of finished products has the potential to damage a manufacturerâ€™s reputation and significantly increase the cost of manufacturing. An innovative approach to nondestructively examine the moisture gradients of different wood species using vertical density profiles from a commercial X-ray based density profiler was described and illustrated. The results indicate that the estimated moisture gradients by the X-ray technique matched well with the actual moisture gradients. It is expected that the new method will provide accurate and prompt information about moisture transfer/movement that will help optimize manufacturing processes.",
