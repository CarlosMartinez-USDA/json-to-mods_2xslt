    "abstract": "A training needs assessment of the primary forest products industry was conducted for 33 eastern states.  his publication presents in detail the statistical analysis of the study. Of the 2,570 lumber manufacturing companies, consisting of firms with more than six employees for the U.S. Department of Labor Standard Industrial Classification Code 2421, the response rate to the survey was 18.1%. The study found that over the next 5 years, 36% of the current skilled positions are projected to be replaced. Based on the number of new key employees that will be needed to replace current employees, the most important fields are lumber grading, millwrighting, and sawyers. Employers are willing to send their employees to training programs, especially those programs that are three to five days in length. The maximum travel distances a regionalized training center should expect to draw from is a 275-mile radius. Employers would be most interested in the core programs of wood products curriculum offered at community colleges in the past, including lumber inspection, sawyer training, and saw filing training.  illwrighting subjects also ranked highly with employers.",
