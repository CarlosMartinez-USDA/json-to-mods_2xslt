    "title": "Nonlinear programming models to optimize uneven-aged loblolly pine management",
    "product_year": " 1999",
    "abstract": "Nonlinear programming models of uneven-aged loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) management were developed to identify sustainable management regimes which optimize: 1) soil expectation value (SEV), 2) tree diversity, or 3) annual sawtimber yields. The models use the equations of SouthPro, a site- and density-dependent, multi-species matrix growth and yield model that recognizes three species groups (loblolly pine and other softwoods, soft hardwoods, and hard hardwoods) and 13 P-inch diameter-at-breast-height size classes. The regimes for optimal diversity almost obtain their theoretical maximum Shannon diversity indices, but have low SEVas. The optimal economic and production regimes each involve a guiding maximum diameter for softwoods and complete hardwood control, with the optimal maximum diameter a function of site productivity. Constrained optimizations  in which SEV is maximized subject to increasing constraints on diversity  show the tradeoffs between economic return and diversity objectives.",
