    "title": "Dynamics of Connecticut hemlock stands",
    "product_year": " 2000",
    "abstract": "The stand dynamics and production of two one-acre plots of eastern hemlock (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i> L) in Connecticut have been followed for more than six decades. Data were recorded for all individual trees. One plot (Saltonstall) was established in 1924 after the removal of a hardwood overstory. This stand had a nearly pure, almost fully closed understory of hemlock that was subjected to partial cuttings in 1936, 1954, and 1956. The stand was lost to the hemlock woolly adelgid (<i>Adelges tsugae</i>) in 1993. The other plot (Perry) was established in 1931 in a nearly pure hemlock stand that had arisen on an abandoned pasture around 1850. This plot had a crop-tree release cutting in 1931 and has not been infested with hemlock woolly adelgid.",
