    "title": "Lignin modification in the initial phase of softwood kraft pulp delignification with polyoxometalates (POMs)",
    "product_year": " 2007",
    "abstract": "Commercial softwood kraft pulp with kappa number 30.5 (KP30.5) was delignified with polyoxometalates (POM, Na5(+2)[SiV1(-0.1)MoW10(+0.1)O40]), and POM-treated kraft pulp of kappa number 23.6 was obtained (KPPOM,23.6). Residual lignin from pulps was isolated by mild acid hydrolysis and characterized by analytical and spectral methods to gain insight into lignin reactions taking place during the initial delignification phase. Lignin from POM-delignified pulp was isolated in lower yield. Comparative analysis of residual lignins (RL-KP30.5, RL-KPPOM,23.6) showed that POM leads to products enriched in carbonyl/carboxyl groups and carbohydrates. POM lignins have a lower molecular mass and a lower content of phenolic hydroxyl and methoxyl groups. Based on these results and FTIR spectra, we suggest that aromatic ring cleavage and quinine formation occur during POM delignification. The degree of lignin-cellulose association increases after POM delignification. Lignin-cellulose association was found to be partially unstable under mild alkaline conditions, as residual lignin isolated after alkaline extraction of KPPOM,23.6 pulp (RL-KPPOM/NaOH) exhibited lower glucose content, higher Klason lignin content, and less extraneous material.",
