    "abstract": "To develop service life prediction methods for the study of sealants, a fully instrumented weather station was installed at an outdoor test site near Madison, WI. Temperature, relative humidiy, rainfall, ultraviolet (UV) radiation at 18 wavelengths, and wind speed and direction are being continuously measured and stored. The weather data can be integrated over time to calculate the dose of the weathering factors. In the study reported here, sealant test specimens were installed in a specially designed apparatus that subjected them to weather-induced cyclic movement that forced a response. Load-deflection information and weather were correlated to yield information on critical factors affecting the sealant performance. The results showed a clear link between the sealant response during weathering and the weather conditions causing this response. Instrumentation of the outdoor test facility and the data collection system ore briefly described and methods for analyzing data are evaluated.",
