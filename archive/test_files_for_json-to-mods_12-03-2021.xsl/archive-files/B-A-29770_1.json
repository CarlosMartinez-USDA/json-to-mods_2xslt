    "title": "Cone calorimeter tests of wood-based decking materials",
    "product_year": " 2007",
    "abstract": "New technologies in building materials have resulted in the use of a wide variety of materials in decks. As part of our effort to address fire concerns in the wildland-urban interface, the Forest Products Laboratory has been examining the fire performance of decking products. In addition to preservative-treated wood, decking products include wood-plastic composites and imported wood species. Requirements for wood-plastic composites are often based on expectation for untreated wood. Claims for imported wood species have included Class A flame spread ratings. This paper discusses results of cone calorimeter tests conducted on a variety of wood-based decking materials.",
