    "title": "Durability and mechanical properties of silane cross-linked wood thermoplastic composites",
    "product_year": " 2007",
    "abstract": "In this study, silane cross-linked wood–polyethylene composite profiles were manufactured by reactive extrusion. These composites were evaluated regarding their durability and mechanical properties in comparison with two non-cross-linked wood– polyethylene composites. An addition of only 2% w/w of silane solution during manufacturing was enough to achieve almost 60% degree of cross-linking after curing. The cross-linked composites showed flexural toughness superior to the non-cross-linked composites. The cross-linked composites also absorbed less moisture during a boiling test in water and this was an indirect evidence of improved interfacial adhesion. After accelerated weathering for 1000–3000h the general trend was a decrease in flexural modulus and strength of both the non-cross-linked and cross-linked composites. The decrease in modulus seemed to be lower for the cross-linked composites while the decrease in strength seemed to be higher compared to the non-cross-linked composites. Weathering also resulted in a considerable colour fading of the composites. Water absorption–freeze–thaw cycling decreased the flexural modulus of non-cross-linked composites considerably while there was no statistical decrease in modulus for the cross- linked composites. There was only an insignificant decrease in strength for the composites after the water absorption–freeze–thaw cycling.",
