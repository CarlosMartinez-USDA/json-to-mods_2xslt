    "product_year": " 1982",
    "abstract": "Water prehydrolysis of aspen wood was compared with 0.40% sulfuric acid prehydrolysis at a reaction temperature of 170Â°C. Acid prehydrolysis gave much higher yields of total anhydroxylose units in the prehydrolyzate and removed significantly less anhydroglucose from the wood than did the water treatment. At maximum yields of total anhydroxylose units in the prehydrolyzates, much more monomeric xylose was present in the acid prehydrolyzate than in the water prehydrolyzate.",
