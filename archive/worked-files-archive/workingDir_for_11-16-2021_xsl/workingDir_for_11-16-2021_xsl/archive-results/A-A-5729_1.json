    "abstract": "This report describes strategies for using the Financial Evaluation of Ecosystem Management Activities (FEEMA) software.  This program was developed as a tool for assessing the financial viability of management activities for removing small trees for manufacture into wood products.  Combinations of tree stands, management activities, and contractual requirements can be ranked along a continuum from actions that are unlikely to pay for themselves under any economic conditions to those that are likely to cover their implementation costs.  The program can be used early in the planning process to obtain information on the potential net value of alternative strategies or later to assess the financial feasibility of a tentative plan.  This report includes information on data input files, validation and interpretation of analysis results, and flexibility of the program.",
