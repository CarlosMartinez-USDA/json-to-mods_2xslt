    "product_year": " 2007",
    "abstract": "This report describes a method to examine full-field displacements of both sides of paperboard during tensile testing. Analysis showed out-of-plane shear behavior near the failures zones. The method was reliably used to examine out-of-plane shear in double notch shear specimens. Differences in shear behavior of machine direction and cross-machine direction specimens are described.",
