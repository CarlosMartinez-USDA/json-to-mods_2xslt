    "title": "Estimating Janka hardness from specific gravity for tropical and temperate species",
    "product_year": " 2007",
    "abstract": "Using mean values for basic (green) specific gravity and Janka side hardness for individual species obtained from the world literature, regression equations were developed to predict side hardness from specific gravity. Statistical and graphical methods showed that the hardnessâ€“specific gravity relationship is the same for tropical and temperate hardwoods, but that the relationship for softwoods is different from that for hardwoods. As expected, the relationship for green wood is different from that for wood at 12% moisture content.",
