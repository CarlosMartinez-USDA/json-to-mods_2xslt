The method uses data on HWP production and trade from several decades and tracks annual additions to pools of HWP in use, removals from use, additions to solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), and decay from SWDS. The method is consistent with IPCC guidance for estimating emissions from SWDS. Uncertainty is postulated in the form of probability density functions for 14 variables, using Monte Carlo simulation.",

The reserved trees that make up the older age class usually meet a variety of objectives such as timber, wildlife food and cover, and aesthetic values. A series of 20 operational cuts in Appalachian hardwood stands was evaluated 2 to 5 years post-logging. Residual stand characteristics such as species composition, density, volume, grade, and damage were investigated to determine the early fate of the reserve trees. Residual stand density across the 20 stands averaged 39 plat, the number of residual trees per acre averaged 47, and the residual stand volume averaged 3,210 bd. ft./ac (Int. 1/4\"). Most of the residual stands were classified as low-risk (69 percent), and only 8 percent of the trees per ac were either standing dead or blown down 2 to 5 years following the harvest.",

American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) was a major competitor to black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) crop trees at each site. The treatments were applied in June and evaluated 12 months after treatment. A numerical rating system ranging from 1 to 7 (0?100% crown affected), which utilized visual symptoms, was used to evaluate the efficacy of each treatment. Trees receiving a rating of 5 (75% crown control) or greater were considered controlled.",

Data were recorded for all individual trees. One plot (Saltonstall) was established in 1924 after the removal of a hardwood overstory. This stand had a nearly pure, almost fully closed understory of hemlock that was subjected to partial cuttings in 1936, 1954, and 1956. The stand was lost to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in 1993. The other plot (Perry) was established in 1931 in a nearly pure hemlock stand that had arisen on an abandoned pasture around 1850. This plot had a crop-tree release cutting in 1931 and has not been infested with hemlock woolly adelgid.",

                "abstract": "Partial cutting to develop two-age stands is a relatively new practice in the central Appalachian region, and forest managers need quantitative information in order to evaluate how well it meets management objectives. Typically, this practice leaves a residual overstory of 10 to 40 ft2 per ac of basal area and leads to regeneration of desirable shade-intolerant species which comprise the second age class. 1n this study we evaluated residual tree quality and regeneration 2 to 5 yr after cutting in 20 stands on the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia. Tree grades were not significantly affected by the cutting. The largest grade reductions, due primarily to epicormic branching and logging wounds, occurred with large white oak sawtimber (11%) and white ash small sawtimber (10%). Epicormic branching following the cut was greatest for white oaks in the suppressed and intermediate crown classes. Across all species, the trees in the lower crown classes produced the greatest number of epicormic branches. Overall, epicormicbranching on the 16ft butt logs of dominant and codominant trees was low. For white oak (Quercus alba), 64% of these trees produced no epicormic branches. But 75% of yellow-poplars (Liriodendron tulipifera), 82% of black cherries (Prunus serotina), 78% of northern red oaks (Quercus rubra), and 89% of white ashes (Fraxinus americana) produced no epicormic branches on butt logs. Logging wounds occurred on 45% of the residual trees across the 20 stands, but 21% had large, wounds over 100 in2. Regeneration of both shade- intolerant and tolerant species was prolific following the cutting. Total numbers of tree seedlings and sprouts ranged from 8,217 stems/ac in the mixed oak stands of the Ridge and Valley Province to 30,845 stems/ac in the beech-cherry-maple stands in the Allegheny Mountains. The birches, primarily sweet birch (Betula lenta), comprised the most abundant species across the study area, but speciescomposition varied depending on forest cover type. Regeneration numbers were lowest in the mixed oak stands in the Ridge and Valley Province.",

We evaluated the economic feasibility of two sizes of BioMax, a generator manufactured by the Community Power Corporation of Littleton, Colorado. At current avoided-cost electricity prices in Oregon, it would not be economical to operate a small-scale (100-kW) BioMax without a subsidy or tax credit, even if fuel were delivered to the plant at a forest landing at no cost. Given a tax credit, a 1,000-kW system could be operated profitably. If it were possible to sell merchantable logs (removed as part of forest health treatments) for an average of $175/thousand board feet, most acres on gentle slopes in southern Oregon would provide net operating surpluses. Most steeply sloped acres would generate operating deficits. If merchantable timber were sold separately, biomass from forest health thinnings on timberland in 15 western states could potentially provide from 2.3 to 14.3 billion kWh of electricity to the national grid. Our results suggest that if a forest landing is located near an existing power line, distributed energy generation is an option that may be worth considering.",

The results indicate highest volumes of logging residue are found in the Douglas-fir region of western Oregon and western Washington. Average gross volume of residue in this region ranged from 4,548 cubic feet per acre on National Forest land to 1,491 cubic feet per acre on private land; net volume averaged 3,127 and 1,328 cubic feet per acre, respectively. Total net volume for all owners in this region was estimated to be about 460 million cubic feet for 1969. The lowest average volume of logging residue was found in the ponderosa pine region of eastern Oregon and eastern Washington--gross aver aged between 350 and 400 cubic feet per acre for all owners. In California, gross volume averaged 1,905 cubic feet per acre for private lands and 1,460 cubic feet per acre for National Forests. Additional information is provided concerning the average and total volume of residue by diameter class, length class, soundness, and type of material.",

The highest volume was on National Forests in the Douglas-fir region, which averaged 2.5 times greater than private lands. The lowest volumes of residue were found in the ponderosa pine region where both private and public lands averaged between 325 and 375 cubic feet per acre. Private lands in California averaged 1,558 cubic feet per acre, while National Forests averaged 1,206 cubic feet per acre. The total net volume of logging residues for all regions was 908 million cubic feet, about 26 percent of the reported 1969 log harvest. In the Douglas-fir region total net volume was 465 million cubic feet, which amounted to 50 percent of the wood consumption by the pulp and board industries in western Oregon and western Washington for 1961.",

Prospective trends in demands for and supplies of timber, and the factors that affect these trends are examined. These trends include changes in the U.S. economy, increased salvage of British Columbia beetle-killed timber, and a stronger U.S. dollar. Other prospective trends that might alter the future timber situation are discussed including changes in U.S. timberland area, reductions in southern pine plantation establishment, impacts of climate change on forest productivity, increased restoration thinning on Western public lands, and the impact of programs to increase carbon sequestration through afforestation. Various management implications such as the influence of prices on forest management, concerns about changes in forest area, the emerging open space issue, forests as a set of commons, seeking to find greater compatibility in forest management, and the stewardship agenda are discussed.",

In the U.S., it is estimated that 90% of all Americans live within 10 miles of a body of contaminated water (Hogue, 2000). The development of filters to clean our water supply is big business. It is estimated that global spending on filtration (including dust collectors, air filtration, liquid cartridges, membranes and liquid macro-filtration) will increase from $17 billion in 1998 to $75 billion by 2020 (Noble, 2000). The fastest-growing non-industrial application area for filter media is for the generation of clean water. One of the prevalent contaminates in our water is metal ions that come from a wide variety of sources including abandoned hard rock and coal mines, highways and large parking lot runoff and natural erosion of minerals. Most methods to remove metal ions from solution are expensive. However, it has been shown that wood and bark are effective in removing metal ions from water (Bryant et al., 1992; Kumar and Dara, 1980; Laszlo and Dintzis, 1994; Randall, 1977).",

The data present current and historical information on the production, trade, consumption, and prices of timber products in the United States. The report focuses on national statistics, but includes some data for individual States and regions and for Canada. The data were collected from industry trade associations and government agencies. They are intended for use by forest land managers, forest industries, trade associations, forestry schools, renewable resource organizations, individuals in the major timber producing and consuming countries of the world, and the general public. A major use of the data is tracking industry production and consumption trends over time. One of the major shifts occurring in the wood using industry over the last 2 years is that both production and consumption of roundwood per capita have been increasing. The consumption of products per capita also increased over the last 2 years. Because of increased paper recycling and increased processing efficiency, the consumption per capita in roundwood equivalent has decreased since about 1987 from 83 ft3 to 72 ft3 per capita. In the 1960s and 1970s, consumption averaged 65 ft3 per capita. Per capita consumption in 2004 increased to 71 ft3 per capita before increasing further in 2005 to 72 ft3 per capita. Another shift occurring during 2005 is increased emphasis on wood energy use, which has shown wide fluctuations over the last decade into 2005.",

In such analysis, arborists are often challenged by internal structural defects hidden from view within the trunks. This paper reports the results of an investigation using acoustic tomography to detect internal decay in park trees. Two century- old red oak (Quercus rubra) trees located at the Capitol Park in Madison, Wisconsin, were nondestructively evaluated using an acoustic tomography technique. The trees were subsequently felled, and a disk at each test location was obtained and examined. We found that the light-colored zones in the tomograms were larger than the true decay present in the disks. The oversized light-colored areas were the composite effects of both decay and large internal cracks. The results of this study demonstrated that acoustic tomograhy cannot distinguish between large internal cracks and heartwood decay. To make a better assessment of internal condition for urban trees, resistance microdrilling should also be used prior to tree removal.",

Initiating kiln drying within 6 days of felling did not reduce staining of ochoó, although many boards with extensive interior stain had bright surfaces, so it is possible that immediate drying might reduce or eliminate discoloration. Shock treatments did not reduce staining either, except for the localized effects of surface hammering. Eighteen-hour treatment with a 5% solution of sodium metabisulfite reduced stain, although penetration was limited in many samples.",

                "abstract": "The carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of Earth\u2019s atmosphere continues to rise. Plants in general are responsive to changing CO2 concentrations, which suggests changes in agricultural productivity in the United States and around the world. The ability of plants to absorb CO2 during photosynthesis and then store carbon in their structure or sequester it in the soil has potential for mitigating the rate of rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Since 1987, Bruce Kimball and coworkers at the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Phoenix, Arizona, have maintained a greenhouse gas experiment using sour orange trees maintained in a CO2-enriched environment. These trees were harvested in 2005. During the final massive harvest, many different properties and characteristics of the woody biomass for these sour orange trees were studied. This report focuses only on the mechanical property evaluation of modulus of elasticity (MOE), specific gravity, and microfibril angle. In this study of CO2-exposed sour orange trees, CO2 did not significantly affect specific gravity of sour orange trees. Exposure to CO2 did not significantly affect MOE of sour orange trees. Exposure to CO2 did, however, seem to influence microfibril angle development. Minor interactions between CO2 and cardinal direction affected the MOE and were caused by experimental difference in chamber construction.",

Bamboo chemical properties were measured at three different heights from one-, three- and five-year-old plants and at three different radial positions from the thre-year-old culms of Phyllostachys pubescenssouth-eastern USA. Small but significant increases in holocellulose and a-cellulose contents were detected from the base to the top of the culm at all three ages. In contrast, no significant differences in Klason lignin and ash were detected. The increases in carbohydrate content with age correlated with increases in specific gravity. Alcohol-toluene extractive content increased from the base to the top of the stem in the three-year-old and five-year-old bamboo and showed a continuous increase with age. The epidermis had the highest extractive and ash contents and the lowest holocellulose and a-cellulose contents. The outer layer of the stem had the highest holocellulose, a-cellulose and Klason lignin contents and the lowest extractive and ash contents. The chemical content and specific gravity of bamboo stabilizes at about three years of age, which is an appropriate time for harvesting.",

Refined aspen wood fiber samples treated with iron salt solutions demonstrated limited capacities to remove (ortho)phosphate from test solutions. To provide additional sites for iron complex formation, and thereby impart a greater capacity for phosphate removal, a fiber pretreatment with an aqueous solution of a non-toxic anionic polymer, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), was evaluated. Problems with excessive viscosities during the screening of commercially available CMC products led to the selection of an ultra low viscosity CMC product that was still usable at a 4% concentration in water. Soxhlet extractions of chipped aspen wood and refined aspen wood fiber samples showed a higher extractives content for the refined material. Analysis of these extracts by FTIR spectroscopy suggested that the higher extractives content for the refined material resulted from the fragmentation of cell wall polymers (e.g., lignin, hemicelluloses) normally insoluble in their native states. Spectroscopic analysis of CMC and ferrous chloride treated fibers showed that the complex formed was sufficiently stable to resist removal during subsequent water washes. Equilibrium sorption data, which fit better with a Freundlich isotherm model than a Langrnuir isotherm model, showed that phosphate removal could be enhanced by the CMC pretreatment. Results suggest that the process outlined may provide a facile means to improve the phosphate removal capacity of biomass-based stormwater filtration media.",

Matchstick-sized wood specimens were steeped in extractive-containing solutions to generate extractive-enriched samples for analysis. decay curves obtained by the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-gill (CPMG) pulse sequence were analyzed with Contin, a constrained regularization program used to generate continuous distributions of transverse (spin-spin) relaxation times. Air-dry wood samples gave maximum signal amplitudes that did not clearly reflect differences in extractives content. Oven drying removed signals for bound water that were superposed with those for extractives. Relaxation times and the corresponding amplitudes were then positively correlated with the added extractives. Treatment of air-dry samples with dichloromethane-d2 prior to analysis increased the mobility of the extractives, thereby resulting in a shift of the corresponding signals to longer relaxation times. this provided the opportunity to quantify the added extractives in presence of bound water.",

To assess the stability of the filtration medium, samples exposed to the test solutions were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. The resultant spectra indicated that a significant amount of the carboxylate functionality, imparted by the CMC, remained with the fiber. Determinations of iron and phosphorous levels in these samples by elemental analysis confirmed that the CMC provided additional sites to complex iron ions, and that phosphate removed from the test solutions was retained within the filtration medium. To better understand the distribution of the CMC in the fiber matrix, treatments were also carried out with CMC containing a polymeric fluorescent dye. Observations by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed partial filling of the fiber lumens. To address concerns related to the hydraulic conductivity of the fibers, aspen wood particles of different sizes were also treated. Results showed that the phosphorous uptake capacity decreased with decreasing particle size. Measurement of iron released into the test solutions suggested that the smaller wood particles may be preferred since they showed the lowest release of iron relative to the amount of phosphate removed.",

Accordingly, there is a need for quality control protocols to assess variability and predict product yields. Southern yellow pine bark samples from two industrial sources were separated into inner and outer bark tissues and used to prepare both predetermined and random bark compositions for analysis. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, coupled with multivariate analysis, was successfully used to develop models to predict relative amounts of inner bark. Application of mathematical treatments to the NIR data improved the calibration performance leading to improved predictions for the test samples. Results presented here show promise for the further development of this technique as a means to provide rapid and accurate predictions of the quality of bark obtainable from industrial sources.",

                "abstract": "One of the variables in phenol formaldehyde adhesive resin formulation is the addition of urea, which allows the resin manufacturer to manipulate both product functionality and cost. Nitrogen content can be used as a measure of the level of urea addition because most of the nitrogen present is derived from urea added at the end of the preparation process. Nitrogen analyses of a set of commercial oriented strandboard resins were first determined by combustion analysis. IR spectroscopic data were then collected and used along with the values for nitrogen content to generate predictive models. First, principal component analysis demonstrated the ability to separate resin mixtures from low to high nitrogen content. Partial least squares regression was then performed and gave excellent correlations between the measured and predicted nitrogen contents for a set of unrelated (test) resins and a set of mixtures prepared through combinations of resins with known nitrogen contents. Similar results were obtained on both a wet and dry mass basis. Given the flexibility of this instrumentation, such analyses could be placed in-line for real time monitoring of resin applied during panel manufacturing",

Therefore, this ascomycete resembles white-rot basidiomycetes in attacking the recalcitrant nonphenolic structures that predominate in lignin.",

A significant effort has been devoted toward developing robust nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies capable of predicting the intrinsic wood properties of individual trees, stems, and logs, and assessing the value of stands and forests. Such technologies can help foresters make wise management decisions, grow higher quality wood, and lead to greater profitability for the forest industry.",

Residual lignin from pulps was isolated by mild acid hydrolysis and characterized by analytical and spectral methods to gain insight into lignin reactions taking place during the initial delignification phase. Lignin from POM-delignified pulp was isolated in lower yield. Comparative analysis of residual lignins (RL-KP30.5, RL-KPPOM,23.6) showed that POM leads to products enriched in carbonyl/carboxyl groups and carbohydrates. POM lignins have a lower molecular mass and a lower content of phenolic hydroxyl and methoxyl groups. Based on these results and FTIR spectra, we suggest that aromatic ring cleavage and quinine formation occur during POM delignification. The degree of lignin-cellulose association increases after POM delignification. Lignin-cellulose association was found to be partially unstable under mild alkaline conditions, as residual lignin isolated after alkaline extraction of KPPOM,23.6 pulp (RL-KPPOM/NaOH) exhibited lower glucose content, higher Klason lignin content, and less extraneous material.",

It is based on the adsorption behavior of toluene (as a tracer) on the hydrophobic surface of microstickies, which affects the apparent vapor-liquid equilibration partitioning of toluene. It was found that the equilibrium concentration of toluene in the vapor phase is inversely proportional to the apparent effective surface area of microstickies that remain in the corresponding solution. Thus, the amount of microsticky materials in the recycled whitewater can be quantified by HS-GC via indirect measurement of the toluene content in the vapor phase of the sample without any pretreatment. The presented method is simple, rapid and automated.",

This manuscript describes a device that combines these two instrumental designs: the ability to both fatigue and characterize multiple sealant samples at the same time. This device employs precise movement capability combined with a stiff loading frame and accurate force measurement for the characterization of five ASTM C719 sealant samples. The performance of this device is demonstrated by monitoring the changes in mechanical properties of silicone sealant during the first 90 h of cure. A complete description of the apparatus, results from the study of curing and analysis is included.",

                "abstract": "Use of wood-based-composites technology to create value-added commodities and traditional construction materials is generally accepted worldwide. Engineered wood- and lignocellulosic-composite technologies allow users to add considerable value to a diverse number of wood- and lignocellulosic feedstocks including small-diameter timber, fast plantation-grown timber, agricultural fibre and lignocellulosic residues, exotic-invasive species, recycled lumber, and timber removals of hazardous forest-fuels. Another potential advantage of this type of economic- and materials-development scenario is that developing industrial composite processing technologies will provide producers an ability to use, and to adapt with, an ever-changing quality level of wood and/or other natural lignocellulosic feedstocks. However, the current level of performance of our state-of-the-art engineered composite products sometimes limit broader application into commercial, non-residential and industrial construction markets because of both real and perceived issues related to fire, structural-performance, and service-life. The worldwide research community has recognized this and is currently addressing each of these issues. From a performance standpoint, this developing knowledge has already and will continue to provide the fundamental understanding required to manufacture advanced engineered composites. From a manufacturing and a resource sustainability standpoint, with this evolving fundamental understanding of the relationships between materials, processes, and composite performance properties we now can in some cases, or may soon be able to, recognize the attributes and quality of an array of bio-based materials then adjust the composite manufacturing process to produce high-performance composite products. As this fundamental understanding is developed, we will increasingly be able to produce advanced, high-performance wood- and bio-composites. Then we must use those technologies as tools to help forest and land managers fund efforts to restore damaged eco-systems and which in turn may further promote sustainable forest management practices.",

                "abstract": "Increasing demands for timber and non-timber forest products often conflict with demands to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem processes. To examine tradeoffs between these goals, we implemented six alternative management systems using a stand-level, replicated experiment. The treatments included four silvicultural regeneration methods designed to sustain timber production, one commercial harvest without regard for future stand values, and a no harvest control. Our goal was to determine effects of management alternatives on multiple system components, including biodiversity, medicinal plants, timber production, terrestrial amphibians, soil disturbance, invasive exotic plants, soil and leaf litter invertebrates, leaf litter decomposition rates and nutrient flux. Plant species richness increased with increasing canopy disturbance, through colonization both by shade-intolerant native species and by exotic species. We detected several species of medicinal plants. Oak regeneration depended more on site quality than treatment. Terrestrial salamander populations declined precipitously on all treatments subjected to canopy disturbance. Although initial soil loss was reduced by using treatments that retained higher levels of basal area in the stand, over a complete rotation, the effects of repeated entries are likely to cause greater soil loss than a clearcut and greater impacts on salamanders.",

The highest ethanol concentration of 41.0 g/L and a yield of 0.38 g/g was obtained using an initial cell concentration of 6.5 g/L. Even though more xylitol was produced when the initial cell concentrations were high, cell density had no effect on the final ethanol yield. A two- parameter mathematical model was used to predict the cell population dynamics at the different initial cell concentrations.

                "abstract": "A universal, rapid DNA assembly method for efficient multigene plasmid construction is important for biological research and for optimizing gene expression in industrial microbes. Three different approaches to achieve this goal were evaluated. These included creating long complementary extensions using a uracil-DNA glycosylase technique, overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, and a SfiI-based ligation method. SfiI ligation was the only successful approach for assembling large DNA fragments that contained repeated homologous regions. In addition, the SfiI method has been improved over a similar, previous published technique so that it is more flexible and does not require polymerase chain reaction to incorporate adaptors. In the present study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes TAL1, TKL1, and PYK1 under control of the 6- phosphogluconate dehydrogenase promoter were successfully ligated together using multiple unique SfiI restriction sites. The desired construct was obtained 65% of the time during vector construction using four-piece ligations. The SfiI method consists of three steps: first a SfiI linker vector is constructed, whose multiple cloning site is flanked by two three-base linkers matching the neighboring SfiI linkers on SfiI digestion; second, the linkers are attached to the desired genes by cloning them into SfiI linker vectors; third, the genes flanked by the three-base linkers, are released by SfiI digestion. In the final step, genes of interest are joined together in a simple one-step ligation.",

These composites were evaluated regarding their durability and mechanical properties in comparison with two non-cross-linked wood\u2013 polyethylene composites. An addition of only 2% w/w of silane solution during manufacturing was enough to achieve almost 60% degree of cross-linking after curing. The cross-linked composites showed flexural toughness superior to the non-cross-linked composites. The cross-linked composites also absorbed less moisture during a boiling test in water and this was an indirect evidence of improved interfacial adhesion. After accelerated weathering for 1000\u20133000h the general trend was a decrease in flexural modulus and strength of both the non-cross-linked and cross-linked composites. The decrease in modulus seemed to be lower for the cross-linked composites while the decrease in strength seemed to be higher compared to the non-cross-linked composites. Weathering also resulted in a considerable colour fading of the composites. Water absorption\u2013freeze\u2013thaw cycling decreased the flexural modulus of non-cross-linked composites considerably while there was no statistical decrease in modulus for the cross- linked composites. There was only an insignificant decrease in strength for the composites after the water absorption\u2013freeze\u2013thaw cycling.",

A recent search of FPL\u2019s library and correspondence files revealed that approximately 10,000 articles, reports, manuals, other technical publications, and communications have been generated and provided to the DoD since 1910. FPL has provided support on a broad array of technical questions\u2014from designing lightweight packaging systems for transporting materiel to Europe and the South Pacific during World War II to assisting in the design and repair of motor mounts for minesweepers used in Desert Storm. This article offers a brief review of some of the contributions FPL has made in support of the United States\u2019 military.",

In this paper, 3-year thermal load histories for wood-based composite roof sheathing, wood rafters, and attics under western redcedar (WRC) shingles, wood-thermoplastic composite (WTPC) shingles, and black and white fiberglass shingles are reported and analyzed. The maximum hourly-average temperatures experienced were 70.7 °C and 61.8 °C for black and white fiberglass shingles, respectively; 48.2 °C for WRC shingles; and 45.7 °C and 46.3 °C for WTPC shingles applied over lath or directly over felt, respectively. On hot summer days, black fiberglass shingles were commonly found to be almost 10 °C hotter than white fiberglass shingles and more than 20 °C hotter than WRC or WTPC shingles. Other components in the roof assemblies and the attic air temperatures followed similar trends. The implications of these thermal loads under different types of roof shingles on comparative service-life for the shingles and the various wood components in the roof systems are discussed.",

                "abstract": "The limited penetration of wood by light explains why the weathering of wood exposed outdoors is a surface phenomenon. Wood is rapidly degraded by short-wave-length UV radiation, but the penetration of light into wood is positively correlated with its wavelength. Hence, subsurface degradation is likely to be caused by longer-wavelength light that still has sufficient energy to degrade wood. In this paper we test this hypothesis and determine the wavelengths of visible light that extend photo-degradation into wood beyond the zone affected by UV radiation. Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) earlywood was exposed to UV and visible light with narrow band gaps (20 nm) and the penetration of light into the wood was measured using a photodetector. Photodegradation was depth-profiled using FT-IR microscopy. There was a positive correlation between the penetration of light into sugi earlywood and the wavelength of the incident radiation within the range 246\u2013496 nm. The depth of photodegradation also increased with wavelength up to and including the violet region (403 nm) of the visible spectrum. Blue light (434\u2013496 nm) penetrated wood to a greater extent than violet light and was capable of bleaching the wood, but it did not significantly modify lignin, and hence it was not responsible for sub-surface photodegradation of wood. We conclude that violet light is the component of the visible spectrum that extends photodegradation into wood beyond the zone affected by UV radiation. Accordingly, surface treatments designed to protect wood used outdoors should shield wood from the effects of violet light.",

The influence of blending method, compatibilizers, and clay content on clay intercalation and exfoliation, RHDPE crystallization behavior, and the mechanical properties of RHDPE/clay hybrids were investigated. Both maleated polyethylene (MAPE) and titanate could improve the compatibilization of RHDPE and clay. RHDPE/clay hybrids containing completely exfoliated clay were obtained using a two-step blending method. Without compatibilizers, the clay could not be exfoliated, and it lowered the crystallization peak temperature, crystallinity level, and the long period of RHDPE. MAPE and clay layers could act as heterogeneous nucleating agents for RHDPE. The titanate had a little influence on crystallization behavior of RHDPE. Adding clay to RHDPE reduced the impact strength but had little influence on the tensile strength. Both the storage and loss moduli increased with up to 5% of clay in hybrids containing CAPS, and there was an about 44% increase in impact strength of RHDPE/clay hybrid containing 5% MAPE compared with that of the hybrid containing no MAPE. The clay presence lowered the thermal stability of RHDPE.",

The influence of clay on crystallization behavior, mechanical properties, water absorption, and thermal stability of HDPE/pine composites was investigated. The HDPE/pine composites containing exfoliated clay were made by a two-step melt compounding procedure with the aid of a maleated polyethylene (MAPE). The use of 2% clay decreased the crystallization temperature (Tc), crystallization rate, and the crystallinity level of the HDPE/pine composites, but did not change the crystalline thickness. When 2% MAPE was added, the crystallization rate increased, but the crystallinity level was further lowered. The flexural and tensile strength of HDPE/ pine composites increased about 20 and 24%, respectively, with addition of 1% clay, but then decreased slightly as the clay content increased to 3%. The tensile modulus and tensile elongation were also increased with the addition of 1% clay. The impact strength was lowered about 7% by 1% clay, but did not decrease further as more clay was added. The MAPE improved the state of dispersion in the composites. Moisture content and thickness swelling of the HDPE/pine composites was reduced by the clay, but the clay did not improve the composite thermal stability.",

In this study, wood flour filled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composites were manufactured through either injection molding or extrusion. A set of extruded composites were also planed to remove the extruded surface. Composites were weathered in a xenon-arc weathering apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the composite surface. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was useful in showing the loss of wood particles from the surface after weathering. Contact angle was higher for the extruded and planed composites compared with the injection molded composites, and was shown using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to be due to lubricant used as a processing aid.",

We evaluated changes in carbohydrate composition and structure as a function of multiple press temperatures (180°, 200°, and 220°C) and an array of hot-pressing durations from 180 to 2500 s. Results show how this thermal degradation in chemical composition directly results in changes in moisture sorption characteristics, physical and mechanical properties, and aboveground durability. For most mechanical properties, it appears that very little degrade occurs until mat temperatures exceed 150°C. Changes in the chemistry of medium density fiberboard seem to result in measurable changes in hygroscopicity, decay, strength, and stiffness. Control of hot-press temperature and duration appears a potential method to heat-treat medium density fiberboard and enhance its serviceability. This heat-treatment effect appears to be related to cumulative thermal load/exposure; subsequent analysis and computational modeling is currently underway.",

Data showed that latewood density and tracheid diameter in suppressed-growth material can vary spatially on a scale comparable to the 50-_m resolution of the instrument used in our testing. An optical imaging method called Ring Profiler was developed to determine what effect SilviScan\u2019s resolution had on the measurements. A single suppressed-growth specimen of Douglas-fir was used to develop the method. Ring Profiler measurements of the specimen showed that SilviScan overestimated latewood tracheid radial diameters by 59% in growth rings averaging 200-_m width. In those same growth rings, SilviScan latewood density was found to be 19% too low. In all growth rings measured by Ring Profiler, latewood wall thicknesses were anisotropic. Radial and tangential values averaged 13% less than the isotropic wall thickness calculated from SilviScan data. Ring Profiler density measurement from binarized images of wood cross-sections was found to correlate well with SilviScan X-ray density (r-squared _ 0.907); however, better images and an objective method for thresholding are needed for accuracy over a large sample space. With these improvements and automated scanning of samples, Ring Profiler could be an attractive, inexpensive complement to SilviScan.",

The average ring width successfully correlated wood density and tracheid anatomical properties of red pines (Pinus resinosa Ait.) from a never-thinned experimental plantation forest with five different initial plantation densities. The results indicate that plantation density has a pronounced effect on earlywood growth, which resulted in increased latewood volumetric fraction and uniform tracheid radial and wall thickness distribution. A similar approach of average ring width correlations may be applied to study wood and tracheid properties of trees growing in the densely populated natural forests.",

Understanding the barriers to commercialization so that ways around, under, over, or through them can be found is also crucial to success. Barriers can include market needs, technology push versus market pull, availability of a window of opportunity, economics, and risk aversion. A good starting point is to understand how the technology will fit in with a potential customer\u2019s operation. Pushing technology usually is not successful because of customer concerns about new products and processes; however, semitechnical education of the end user is an effective way to build market pull. Evaluating the economics of new technology is important not only to comprehend the potential of the new technology, but also to understand the most effective use of resources in the technology development. Risk aversion on the part of the customer often overrules the potential economic benefits of a new technology in the decision making process. To address these issues, many corporations have established stage-gate and portfolio-management processes. These concepts can be used effectively even without the establishment of a formal process. Both successful and unsuccessful new products and new processes are provided to illustrate these issues and the ways to solve them.",

Severe deformation of finished products has the potential to damage a manufacturer\u2019s reputation and significantly increase the cost of manufacturing. An innovative approach to nondestructively examine the moisture gradients of different wood species using vertical density profiles from a commercial X-ray based density profiler was described and illustrated. The results indicate that the estimated moisture gradients by the X-ray technique matched well with the actual moisture gradients. It is expected that the new method will provide accurate and prompt information about moisture transfer/movement that will help optimize manufacturing processes.",

Temperature, relative humidiy, rainfall, ultraviolet (UV) radiation at 18 wavelengths, and wind speed and direction are being continuously measured and stored. The weather data can be integrated over time to calculate the dose of the weathering factors. In the study reported here, sealant test specimens were installed in a specially designed apparatus that subjected them to weather-induced cyclic movement that forced a response. Load-deflection information and weather were correlated to yield information on critical factors affecting the sealant performance. The results showed a clear link between the sealant response during weathering and the weather conditions causing this response. Instrumentation of the outdoor test facility and the data collection system ore briefly described and methods for analyzing data are evaluated.",

Cornstalk, among the agricultural residues and other non-wood fiber, is the most promising source of fiber. However, The usage of cornstalks is very limited in pulp and paper industry, although nearly 284 million tons/year are available worldwide, including 150 million tons/year in the United States. Cornstalk contains about 27% hemicelluloses, which is higher than most of the hardwoods and non-wood fiber materials. Preservation of hemicelluloses in papermaking fiber is important for increased fiber-to-fiber bonding and pulp yield. Unfortunately, in conventional pulping process, most of the hemicelluloses are degraded and ends up in pulping liquor. The calorific value of hemicelluloses derivatives in black liquor is very low compare to lignin derivatives. A value added alternative is to partially extract hemicellulose in cornstalk prior to pulping by dilute acid hydrolysis in the form of sugar suitable for fermentation into ethanol without reducing fiber quality. Dilute acid hydrolysis process under various conditions has been applied for partial removal of hemicelluloses. The residual materials were pulped using soda-AQ process. The separation of hemicelluloses is optimized to protect the paper strength properties.",

This breakthrough in redox catalysis shows promise for the development of a new environmentally benign technology for pulp bleaching. The electrochemical process, applied with a mildly alkaline electrolyte solution containing trace amounts of a vanadium-based polyoxometalate, K5[SiVW11O40], decreased the kappa number of a softwood Kraft pulp by about 40% without significant change in the viscosity of the pulp. In a similar electrochemical process, a softwood semi-bleached Kraft pulp was further bleached to a high brightness pulp, above 85% ISO, by electrolysing a borax-based electrolyte activated with tetraacetylethylenediamine in a pulp suspension.",

The beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) veneers were treated with either monoammonium phosphate, diammonium phosphate, lime water or a borax/boric acid (1 : 1 by weight) mixture. Physical and mechanical properties of the specimens were performed according to EN and DIN standards. A cone calorimeter was used to determine their combustion characteristics. The physical and mechanical properties of the specimens were adversely affected by the treatments. The specimens treated with lime water had the best physical performance while the specimens treated with borax/boric acid had the highest mechanical properties. The fire retardant treatments of the face veneers were effective in reducing the initial contribution of heat release to potential fire growth. In particular, the lime water treatment was an effective fire retardant treatment in that it reduced both the effective heat of combustion and the mass loss rate. It also delayed the times for sustained ignition.",

                "abstract": "This study evaluated a series of single-layer, randomly oriented strandboard panels made with one resin type, a single resin loading level, and four fire-retardant-treatment levels. The fire retardant (FR) evaluated was a pH-buffered combination of boric acid and organic phosphate. Siberian larch strands were separated into five batches. One batch of strands served as the untreated control group and was not treated with water or FR; the four other batches were individually treated using a vacuum\u2013pressure\u2013soak process of the strands in water or three progressively higher concentrations of FR solutions. Targeted water-or FR-loading levels were no FR (0% FR-weight gain, water-treated control), 32 kg/m3 FR (&8764;5% weight gain), 64 kg/m3 FR (&8764;10% weight gain), and 96 kg/m3 FR (&8764;15% weight gain). All water-or FR-treated strands were redried to less than 8% moisture content prior to diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) resin application in rotary blenders using an aerosol sprayer. Three replicate specimens for each treatment level of 12.5-mm-thick, randomly oriented strandboard at a density of 650 kg/m3 were evaluated. FR-treated strandboard had higher dry-and wet-internal bond strength and lower flexural strength than matched untreated strandboard. A Class B flame-spread rating was achieved near 10% FR-loading. These results suggest that better ratings seem possible at higher loadings.",

This study demonstrated the utilization of wood chips produced from thinnings for the production of thermomechanical pulp (TMP). Both whole-log chips (primarily from small-diameter logs, tops, and reject logs) and sawmill \u201cresidue\u201d chips from a Hewsaw system (Mäntyharju, Finland) were evaluated. The residue chips produced in this study were substituted for a TMP mill\u2019s standard residue chips up to about 50%. The whole-log chips were substituted for the mill\u2019s whole-log chips up to about 30%. The results show that substitution of chips produced from forest thinnings reduced refining energy in all trials. Pulp quality was maintained throughout all trials.",

                "abstract": "Pulp and paper are converted to paper products with yields of paper dependent on the wood and the process used. Even with high yield pulps there are conversion losses and with chemical pulps the yields approach 50%. The portions of the wood that do not provide product are either combusted to generate power and steam or incur a cost in waste water treatment. Value prior to pulping is an approach to pulping that tries to recover the carbohydrate components that do not enter the paper product before the pulping process has been started. We describe here an approach that releases hemicellulosic sugars from wood chips (both softwoods and hardwoods). Treatment of wood chips with oxalic acid solutions or diethyl oxalate in a vapor phase deposits oxalic acid within the wood chip where it will hydrolyze the hemicellulose. Solutions of these hydrolysates are readily fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia stipitis or Escherichia coli. The treated wood chips are improved sources for pulp and paper production. The high yield thermomechanical pulps require 30-50% less electrical refiner energy and result in a stronger paper product. Chips treated prior to kraft pulping have similar yields of pulp, but decreased kappa values for the same cooking conditions. The pretreatments described hold promise for the generation of new products from existing manufacturing infrastructure while improving traditional processes.",

As part of our effort to address fire concerns in the wildland-urban interface, the Forest Products Laboratory has been examining the fire performance of decking products. In addition to preservative-treated wood, decking products include wood-plastic composites and imported wood species. Requirements for wood-plastic composites are often based on expectation for untreated wood. Claims for imported wood species have included Class A flame spread ratings. This paper discusses results of cone calorimeter tests conducted on a variety of wood-based decking materials.",

For certain tests, this manifests itself as a test difference upon 180° in-plane rotation of the sheet. Seven of eight different paper grades ranging in grammage from 73 to 268 g/m2 were found to show this difference for Scott internal bond tests, directional brightness tests, or both. Directional effects were compared using an extensional and a shear metric. One-third of comparisons showed significant directional effects at the 75-100% confidence level, including roughly equal numbers of Scott bond and brightness comparisons. However, the two tests did not reinforce each other strongly; agreement regarding directional effects occurred in only 60% of comparisons. The number of significant effects in the cross-machine direction matched those in the machine direction (MD), suggesting a more complex model may he needed. The best support for the fiber-tilt model was in the case of MD Scott-internal-bondtesting.",

Two-phase composite models of the cell wall have led many to view their primary function as one of coupling cellulose and lignin to enhance the mechanical properties of the walls. But that is a microscopic interpretation based on macroscopic theories of reinforced structures. In contrast, recent studies have shown that hemicelluloses can participate in regulation of the nanoscale architecture of cell wall constituents. They influence the aggregation of celluloses, and they can also influence the pattern of inter-unit linkages in lignin analogs polymerized in their presence. It is clear that the hemicelluloses have higher functions than as mechanical coupling agents in a two-phase composite. The hemicelluloses are species and tissue specific, and they have also been shown to vary across the layers of cell walls in patterns that are similar for cells formed contemporaneously in the same tissue. Their structures are clearly genetically encoded. In this report it is proposed that the hemicelluloses have multiple functions in regulation of cell wall consolidation and in determining its properties. The hemicelluloses are viewed as part of a system whereby information encoded in the genes is communicated to regulate the assembly of the cell wall. In addition to their role in regulating the aggregation of cellulose and the formation of inter-unit linkages in lignin, they appear to act in concert with extra-cellular glycosidases, to accomplish gradual dehydration of the polysaccharide matrix within which lignin precursors are polymerized. These proposals are based on viewing the deposition and consolidation of the secondary wall as the result of multiple, simultaneous and sequential processes for synthesis of cell wall constituents wherein the syntheses are distributed in both space and time. The spatially distributed syntheses are considered essential to allow gradual modification of the molecules of the precursors of cell wall constituents. They begin as molecules optimized for solubility within the aqueous environment in the cell and are transformed into ones that can be consolidated within the secondary wall, which is more hydrophobic upon lignification. To add clarity to the analysis, a system theoretic approach to the discussion of the distribution of the biogenetic processes in space is adopted. The overall system within each cell is regarded as three highly coupled subsystems. The nanoscale organization in the native state is then examined as a reflection of the processes of biogenesis of the plant cell walls. Issues associated with aggregation of the constituents are then considered and plausible pathways for the assembly of the matrix that are based on distributed synthesis of the major polymeric constituents are suggested. The molecular organization is regarded as the first stationary level of expression of phenotypic form and the implications of the similarity of this expression within contemporaneous cells in an annual ring of secondary growth are examined. It is concluded that all aspects of molecular organization must be governed by intracellular processes that can be orchestrated at levels well beyond those of the individual cells. It is proposed that the primary molecular carriers of organizing information, that is the mediators of the orchestration, are the hemicelluloses, and the manner of their action in the formation of the structure of lignin is suggested. The results of the analysis of hierarchic organization have a number of additional implications with respect to structure and its formation that are beyond the scope of the present report. One that is worthy of note at this time is that the organization of the deposition of the secondary wall, and its systematic",

HexA affects the kappa number determination by reaction with permanganate, and can react with certain bleaching chemicals, e.g. chlorine dioxide and ozone, but not with some others such as oxygen and peroxide. The method is based on the highly selective hydrolysis of HexA from a pulp sample in a mercuric chloridesodium acetate solution. Complete hydrolysis of HexA from pulps is achieved within 30 minutes by choosing the appropriate hydrolysis conditions (the concentration of the hydrolysis agent and the composition of the hydrolysis solution) and temperature. The amount of HexA is directly determined by UV spectrophotometry from the resulting hydrolysis solution (1). A dual-wavelength spectroscopic technique (at 260 and 290 nm) is used to eliminate the spectral interference from the leached lignin in the resulting solution.",

In order to obtain a better understanding of how such organizations are structured and administered, and how they judge organizational performance, a review of forest products and related research organizations beyond the boundaries of the United States was undertaken in 2004-2005. Ninety-three research organizations were initially identified for review, 40 of which were selected for in-depth examination (located in 23 countries) (Table 1). They were selected in order to: (a) provide a sampling of organizations operating in various countries worldwide, (b) enable review of publicly and privately sponsored organizations, and (c) permit access to a diversity of organizational structures and administrative procedures. The lead administrator of each organization was given an opportunity to review the draft narrative describing the organization. In addition, each lead administrator was asked to provide advice about structural, managerial, and performance conditions that are considered necessary if a forest products research and development organization is to accomplish its mission. Thirty administrators of the 40 organizations reviewed willingly provided commentaries.",

                "abstract": "An analysis of the effectiveness of anthraquinone (AQ) in kraft-AQ pulping in terms of its mechanism of transport has been conducted. Our previous work showed that caustic solutions of wood lignin can decrease the membrane exclusion for anthraquinones, i.e., the presence of wood lignin enhances the ability of AQ to pass through a membrane when a reducing agent is present in the acceptor stream. This work seeks to demonstrate that a similar behavior may occur during pulping. The adsorption behavior of AQ species was analyzed, and it was shown that anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQ-S), a water soluble derivative of AQ, selectively adsorbed on wood. The adsorption of AQ dispersed in a caustic lignin solution also showed selective adsorption on wood, to an even greater extent than the AQ-S. This adsorption behavior, along with the membrane penetration behavior described in our previous work, leads to a mechanism for the transport of AQ into wood chips during kraft pulping.",

Synergisms between hydrogen production and biomass gasification technologies will be necessary to avoid being marginalized in the biofuel marketplace. Five feasible engineering solutions have been suggested for this synergism. We are researching one solution to investigate cleaner and more-efficient wood gasification via high-temperature liquid metal as a carrier fluid and making use of hydrogen, power, and waste heat from future nuclear reactors. The enrichment of syngas with nuclear, windmill, or solar hydrogen permits full conversion of all carbon from biomass to produce competitive synthetic gasoline, diesel, or other liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels.",

We used cupric oxide ligninolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to show that Curvularia inaequalis, a widely distributed litter ascomycete, chlorinated the aromatic rings of lignin in wood that it was degrading. In aspen wood decayed for 24 weeks, two chlorolignin fragments, 5-chlorovanillin and 2-chlorosyringaldehyde, were each found at 10 [mu]g/g of wood (dry weight). These levels resemble those of similar structures generally found in unpolluted environmental samples. Fractionation of the extractable proteins followed by wood contained a previously described C. inaequalis chloroperoxidase that very likely catalyzed lignin chlorination. Chlorolignin produced by this route and humus derived from it are probably significant components of the global chlorine cycle because chloroperoxidase-producing fungi are ubiquitous in decaying lignocellulose and lignin is the earth\u2019s most abundant aromatic substance.",

High-density polyethylene (HDPE) based WPCs made from modified wood flour (untreated, extractives free, and holocellulose (delignified) fibers) were subjected to accelerated (xenon-arc) weathering. Colorimetry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were employed to monitor the color change and surface chemistries of the weathered WPC surface. The compositional change that occurred on the WPC surface was determined using pyrolysis GC-MS analysis. The study showed that longer exposure time caused higher oxidation, lower wood lignin and higher plastic content of the weathered WPC surface. From this study, the use of holocellulose fibers improved the weathering performance (color) of WPCs.",

The disks included red pine obtained from a never-thinned experimental forest with five different plantation densities and Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine (one normal growth and the other suppressed growth) both supplied by a sawmill. The results indicated that the effect of tree-growing conditions can be effectively characterized by radial annual growth rate. Growth suppression produced wood with less distinction in wood density, tracheid radial diameter, and wall thickness between earlywood and latewood.",

                "abstract": "Wood is a naturally formed organic material consisting essentially of elongated tubular elements called cells arranged in a parallel manner for the most part. These cells vary in dimensions and wall thickness with position in the tree, age, conditions of growth, and kind of tree. The walls of the cells are formed principally of chain molecules of cellulose, polymerized from glucose residues and oriented as a partly crystalline material. These chains are aggregated in the cell wall at a variable angle, roughly parallel to the axis of the cell. The cells are cemented by an amorphous material called lignin. The complex structure of the gross wood approximates a rhombic system. The direction parallel to the grain and the axis of the stem is longitudinal (L), the two axes across the grain are radial (R) and tangential (T) with respect to the cylinder of the tree stem. This anisotropy and the molecular orientation account for the major differences in physical and mechanical properties with respect to direction which are present in wood.",

The influence of cryolite crystal size [0 (control), 0.2, and 20 pm diameter particles] on the overall mortality of termites consuming the bait was determined in forced feeding bioassays. Only baits containing 20 pm diameter cryolite crystals increased termite mortality significantly above the control treatment. An additional study examining feeding on stained bait (control and 20 pm diameter cryolite crystals only) indicated that termites will consume the bait, and that termite mortality from feeding on the bait increases over time.",

The intent was to obtain a better understanding of how such organizations are structured and administered and their performance judged. Investing over $600 million annually, the 40 organizations employed 7,000 to 7,500 scientists and supporting staff. Especially noteworthy about the organizations are the many ways in which they identify themselves (such as institutes, laboratories, centers); their long history of sustained involvement in forest products research; and their movement from public to private ownership (whole or in part). The distinction between public and private sector responsibility for research is blurry with these organizations, as often they have public sponsorship, yet private operation and management. They offer a wide range of services to clients yet have complex ownership and partnering arrangements. Their organizational structures are seemingly scrambled with forest product research subunits located within larger parent organizations (with broad multisector research responsibilities) and specialized services to a single major group of clients. These organizations have an intense desire to meet the needs of clients, and feature the following: synthesis of existing information as an important service; fees charged for services provided; strategic interest in clients located throughout the world; educational and degree-granting activities; multiple sources of income and revenue; diverse tandards for measuring performance; adept response to broad economic-social changes; multiple location of physical facilities; and differing degrees of publicly available information describing mission and operation of organizations.",

Whereas considerable information exists on property estimation from full data sets, much less information is available on property estimation using censored data. To assess the need for a more rigorous study, a small simulation study was conducted to identify potential problems that could be associated with censoring effects on property estimates from an assumed Weibull distribution for use in reliability-based standards such as ASTM D 5457. Results suggest that reasonable estimates of property percentiles may be obtained when the censoring point is above the percentile needed. However, censoring also affects the estimate of the Weibull shape parameter, and therefore the coefficient of variation. This is important because the coefficient of variation is used to estimate the data confidence factor and the normalization factor also used in determining the data resistance factor. The simulation suggests that for a given sample size, the estimate of Weibull-shape parameter gets better as more of the distribution is included. Further studies are recommended to provide guidance on use of censored data with both the two- and three-parameter Wiebull distributions.",

To develop these confidence bounds and test, we first establish that estimators based on Newton steps from n-consistent estimators may be used in place of efficient solutions of the likelihood equations in likelihood ratio, Wald, and Rao tests. Taking a quadratic mean differentiability approach, Lehmann and Romano have outlined proofs of similar results. We take a Cramer condition approach and make the conditions and their use explicit.",

                "abstract": "Invasive and small-diameter species have become more prevalent, creating numerous environmental and ecological problems. One potential method to control and eliminate invasive species and thereby promote natural rangeland restoration is developing new, value-added uses for them. Saltcedar (Tamarisk ramosissima) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) were investigated for use as fillers in wood\u2013plastic composites (WPCs). The chemical composition and thermal stability of wood flours from both invasive species were compared with those of commercial pine wood flour. The wood flours were compounded with plastic and additives, and the viscosities of the composite melts containing the different species were compared. Composites produced from the compounded material by profile extrusion and injection molding were evaluated for mechanical performance, appearance, and weatherability. Saltcedar wood flour had the most minerals and water soluble extractives, which resulted in the lowest thermal stability and the lowest melt viscosity when compounded with high-density polyethylene. Injection-molded WPCs made from saltcedar or juniper were both considerably darker than those made with pine but performed similarly in accelerated weathering tests. Their mechanical properties were generally lower than those of the composites made from pine, but appropriate application selection and proper design could help compensate. Extruded WPCs were successfully made with each of the species. Producing WPCs from these composites appears technically feasible, although continued formulation development and durability evaluation are needed so that informed decisions regarding applications can be made. Economically feasible applications that use the advantageous properties of these species and that can tolerate or address the less desirable ones need to be identified and demonstrated.",

                "abstract": "The number of larger, permanent softwood lumber mills in the United States and Canada has shrunk from 1,311 in 1995 to 990 as of June 2007. These mills had a combined capacity of 190.2 million m3 (80.6 × 109 board feet), slightly down from the 2005 value. In 2006, they produced 171 million (nominal) m3 (72.3 × 109 board feet) of lumber, and in the process, generated approximately 0.56 oven-dried metric tons of chips and 0.23 tons of saw-dust and shavings for every 2.36 m3 (1,000 board feet) of lumber produced. Of the chips, 95% were used for pulp and the contribution of this product stream to sawmill economics was approximately $2.1 billion (109) U.S. dollars. Of the sawdust and shavings, 59% were used for boards, 25% for fuel, 7% for animal bedding, 4% for pellets, and about 5% were unused or unaccounted for. Employment dropped to about 93,000 people, down from 99,000 in 2005 and 115,000 in 1995. Economic prospects for the industry are clouded by overcapacity because of weakness in demand caused by a cyclical downturn in housing. Longer term influences include the ongoing mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic in British Columbia that threatens to cut timber supplies over the next 5 to 10 years and the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement affecting the terms under which lumber is imported from Canada into the United States.",

About 6,000 board feet of lumber, ranging in size from 3 in. by 8 in. to 3 in. by 12 in., was remilled into four products including log cabin siding, V-groove paneling, beadboard (wainscoting), and tongue and groove flooring. The general quality of the products produced was high and little loss was found after processing, although checks, ringshake, and face-nail holes were found in some pieces. The yield of value-added products was rather low (about 33%) and was constant over lumber size and product type. The authors believe yield could be increased with better on-site trimming.",

Of the 2,570 lumber manufacturing companies, consisting of firms with more than six employees for the U.S. Department of Labor Standard Industrial Classification Code 2421, the response rate to the survey was 18.1%. The study found that over the next 5 years, 36% of the current skilled positions are projected to be replaced. Based on the number of new key employees that will be needed to replace current employees, the most important fields are lumber grading, millwrighting, and sawyers. Employers are willing to send their employees to training programs, especially those programs that are three to five days in length. The maximum travel distances a regionalized training center should expect to draw from is a 275-mile radius. Employers would be most interested in the core programs of wood products curriculum offered at community colleges in the past, including lumber inspection, sawyer training, and saw filing training. illwrighting subjects also ranked highly with employers.",

The objective of this research was to determine the moduli of rupture (MOR) and elasticity (MOE) of the stem wood of this species at different vertical sampling locations. Three Chinese tallow trees were felled and cut into bolts before sampling along the east and west radial directions. It was found that Chinese tallow tree has sufficient bending strength for low to medium structural uses. Tree, bolt, and sampling direction were all found to be significant sources of variation for the MOR and MOE data.",

The pulping processes were stone groundwood, pressurized stone groundwood, refiner mechanical, thermomechanical, chemimechanical (alkaline sulfite), chemithermomechanical, bleached chemithermomechanical, peroxide chemimechanical, steam explosion, and biomechanical. Data were obtained from USDA Forest Service reports and other literature. Pulps made using chemical pretreatments of the chips gave considerably higher handsheet strength properties than those produced from the groundwood types. This difference was not explained by chemical compositions. Chemical Sulfonation composition changed little, except for sulfonation of those pubs pretreated with sulfur-containing compounds. The light-scattering coefficients and fiberizing energies were reduced in the pulps from chemically pretreated pubs. The biomechanical pubs showed lignin loss with improved handsheet strength properties.",

At pulping temperature, 170°C, only the primary amine adduct was detected. The quinone methide from guaiacylglycerol-ß-guaiacyl ether gave analogous adducts at 40°C, but no quinone methide-amine adducts were detected at 170°C. Instead, the major products were the vinyl ether and a substituted vinyl ether which resulted from a Mannich reaction of the vinylether, amine, and liberated formaldehyde.",

Papers presented at this workshop brought together technical specialists and exhibitors from forest products industry, associations, universities, and private, state, and federal land management agencies. Topics included: policy and management shifts necessary to link healthy forests, communities, and industries; silvicultural concerns for future forest potential; enhancing value in lumber, engineered timber products, processing of finished wood products, and special (craft and nontimber) forest products; and assessment of Alaska forest products industry\u2019s competitive position within state, national, and in Pacific Rim markets. As the first technology transfer event of the Wood Utilization Research and Development Center, the Alaska Value-Added Forest Products Workshop set the stage for developing a strong research and development program for the new center. The center\u2019s mission includes working with community partners to identify and evaluate the opportunities for small businesses and examining how small businesses benefit the local economy. The Alaska Wood Utilization Research and Development Center opened in Sitka in January 1999. Congress directed its creation to identify and evaluate \"value-added\" activities that may provide a durable mix of employment, profits, and forest products industry in Alaska. The Center is a part of the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station.",

                "abstract": "Solid wood is important to the construction, manufacturing, and shipping segments of the U.S. economy. Nearly all new houses are built with wood, and wood building products are used in the construction of nonresidential buildings, and in the upkeep and improvement of existing structures. Solid wood is used extensively to produce and transport manufactured products. It also provides a renewable energy source for industrial, commercial, and residential applications. In 1998, 19.6 billion cubic feet, roundwood equivalent, of all timber products were consumed in the United States, down slightly from 1996, but considerably greater than in 1962. About 87 percent of this was for industrial products, and 13 percent for fuelwood. Excluding fuelwood, solid wood timber products accounted for about 67 percent of the industrial roundwood consumed, and pulpwood products about 33 percent. Large amounts of residues are generated in the production of solid wood products, about 10 to 15 percent of total industrial roundwood consumption. Thus, solid wood products and pulpwood products each account for about half of the industrial roundwood consumed. This report examines solid wood timber products consumption in the United States over the past 40 to 45 years, relates changes in consumption to economic, social, and institutional factors during the period, and presents estimates of consumption in major end-use markets. Trends in timber products production, foreign trade, and domestic consumption over the past half century also are examined.",

This program was developed as a tool for assessing the financial viability of management activities for removing small trees for manufacture into wood products. Combinations of tree stands, management activities, and contractual requirements can be ranked along a continuum from actions that are unlikely to pay for themselves under any economic conditions to those that are likely to cover their implementation costs. The program can be used early in the planning process to obtain information on the potential net value of alternative strategies or later to assess the financial feasibility of a tentative plan. This report includes information on data input files, validation and interpretation of analysis results, and flexibility of the program.",

The models use the equations of SouthPro, a site- and density-dependent, multi-species matrix growth and yield model that recognizes three species groups (loblolly pine and other softwoods, soft hardwoods, and hard hardwoods) and 13 P-inch diameter-at-breast-height size classes. The regimes for optimal diversity almost obtain their theoretical maximum Shannon diversity indices, but have low SEVas. The optimal economic and production regimes each involve a guiding maximum diameter for softwoods and complete hardwood control, with the optimal maximum diameter a function of site productivity. Constrained optimizations in which SEV is maximized subject to increasing constraints on diversity show the tradeoffs between economic return and diversity objectives.",

The Colville National Forest selected the Rocky II Timber Sale as an example of this type of stand that needed management to achieve the following goals: (1) create late successional forest structure, (2) decrease forest health risk from fire, insects, and disease, (3) improve wildlife habitat by providing large green trees and snags, and (4) improve stand aesthetics by decreasing stand density. The Colville Study was divided into four technical focus areas: Silviculture and Ecology, Forest Operations, Timber Conversion, and Economics. Results of each technical focus area indicate that (1) vegetative management activities are necessary to achieve the ecosystem goals, (2) there are alternative harvesting systems for removing the timber in an ecologically sound manner but costs need to be considered, (3) both species and material size are important in the recovery of wood products, and (4) financial analysis needs to incorporate all of these factors and many more to effectively evaluate the relative merchantability of different types of treatments.",
